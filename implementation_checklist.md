## 1. Prepare Environment

1. [x] **Check Node.js installation**  
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - If Node.js is not installed, or if it's older than Node.js 16.x, install the latest LTS (16.x or higher) from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).  
   - Verify installation again:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```

2. [x] **Check npm installation**  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```
   - If npm is missing, install it (it usually comes with Node.js).  
   - Verify installation again:
     ```bash
     npm -v
     ```

3. [x] **Check Yarn installation (optional, but recommended)**  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     yarn -v
     ```
   - If Yarn is not installed, install it:
     ```bash
     npm install --global yarn
     ```
   - Verify installation again:
     ```bash
     yarn -v
     ```

4. [x] **Check AWS CLI installation**  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     aws --version
     ```
   - If AWS CLI is not installed, follow official instructions: [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).  
   - Verify installation again:
     ```bash
     aws --version
     ```

5. [x] **Configure AWS CLI**  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```
   - Provide your AWS Access Key, AWS Secret Key, AWS region, and output format (e.g., `json`) when prompted.  
   - Verify credentials by listing S3 buckets (this step ensures you have valid credentials):
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls
     ```
   - If it succeeds (or shows an empty list if you have none), your credentials are configured.

6. [x] **Check Docker installation**  
   - Run:
     ```bash
     docker -v
     ```
   - If Docker is not installed, install it from [Docker's official site](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  
   - Verify Docker by running:
     ```bash
     docker run hello-world
     ```
   - Ensure it outputs a "Hello from Docker!" message.

---

## 2. Initialize Project

7. [x] **Create and navigate into an empty project directory**  
   ```bash
   mkdir ChatGenius
   cd ChatGenius
   ```
   - Project directory created as "ChatGenius"

8. [x] **Initialize a new Git repository**  
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   - Verify `.git/` is created - ✓ Already initialized

9. [x] **Initialize a new Next.js app**  
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
   ```
   - Selected No for Turbopack (experimental feature)
   - Verified creation of Next.js files: `next.config.ts`, `package.json`, `src/`, etc.
   - App Router enabled, TypeScript configured, Tailwind CSS installed

10. [x] **Add `.gitignore` file if not already present**  
   - ✓ `.gitignore` already generated by `create-next-app` with comprehensive ignores:
     ```bash
     ls -la .gitignore
     ```
   - Verified it includes all standard Node/Next.js ignores:
     - node_modules
     - .next
     - out
     - .env files
     - logs
     - TypeScript files
     - testing files

- Zustand, React Hook Form, and Zod for state management and forms.
- Docker + Prisma for local dev.
- AWS Amplify for deployment.
- A multi-layered directory structure with extensive README.md documentation.

Continue filling in and refining each piece as your application logic evolves. The skeleton is ready and should work locally and in production!
